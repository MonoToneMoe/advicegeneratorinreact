Advice Generator in React
Using React and Typescript I attempted to recreate the the design given as faithfully as possible
Peer Reviewed By: Sebastian Breve-Sanchez
Peer Review: The API calling works, making the website functional. The "Advice" looks better in all caps, and perhaps bolded as well. The mobile looks well at 425 px width, however the style guide states mobile should be 375 px width, if you want to adjust for that as well. The box hugs the borders at 375. Other than than well done.
